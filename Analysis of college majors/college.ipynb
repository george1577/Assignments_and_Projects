The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)."
